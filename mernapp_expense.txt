to run the client and server as mentioned in oour package.json file..

what is middlewares

to run the server : 
npx nodemon server.js
npm run server.js

where server.js is the main file
as written in the package.jsonn file



what is mvc ??

inorder to create our new database for our new project 
just open mongodb atlas then database , then browssse collections , in that
we have to tap on create database in that we can crreate a new database...

now we can add data manualy , but we will choose to add it through our backend..
we will connect backend with mongodb
then create a crud operation

to connect what we do is go in overview then connect it using
mongodb compass : then change the url and add that url to .env file 
also connect compass using the same url


above is not the method to connect mongodb with backend ..
it is done with the help of moongoose , it is also helpful in creating schemas
and also to create crud operations


after connecting database with the bbackend..
we will create a user schmea in userModel.js
